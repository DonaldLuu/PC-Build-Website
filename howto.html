			<h3>Before Getting Started</h3>
			<gettingstarted>
				To make a computer fully operation functional, you have to buy the computer parts when building your own gaming PC:
				​<ul>
					<li>CPU/Processor</li>
					<li>CPU Cooler</li>
					<li>Motherboard</li>
					<li>Memory/RAM</li>
					<li>Storage Drive (Such as Hard Drive Disk (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD))</li>
					<li>Video Card/GPU</li>
					<li>Case</li>
					<li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
				</ul>
			</gettingstarted>
			
			<!-- Part 1 -->
			<h3>Step 1: Installing Storage Drives and Power Supply</h3>
			
			<!-- Remove Panels -->
			
			<p>
			First off, removing panels on side of PC case by unscrewing with either your hand or screwdriver. Make sure to put the screws somewhere like putting screws in the bowl, so that you don't lose it during a process because we're going to use it again near the end. After the screws are off, gently slide the panel off as shown in the picture.
			</p>

			</div>
			<p>To see it better, unscrew two more screws on side panels as shown in the picture. Then, lift the top panel case by using your hand.</p>
			
			<p>

			<p>Now the case is open, inside the case contain wires that is already attached to the front panel case, which we'll connect to the motherboard later on. There's also bag of screws that should came with and make sure to not lose it.</p>
			
			<p>For the storage drive, just pinch the grip of the storage case and screw underneath the SSD/HDD using screws that came from the case.</p>

​			<p>For the Power Supply, insert the case and screw on the back panel case using screws that came from the case shown in the picture.</p>

			<h3>Step 2: Installing CPU, CPU Cooler, and Memory Stick on Motherboard</h3>
			<p>
			First off, removing panels on side of PC case by unscrewing with either your hand or screwdriver. Make sure to put the screws somewhere like putting screws in the bowl, so that you don't lose it during a process because we're going to use it again near the end. After the screws are off, gently slide the panel off as shown in the picture.
			</p>
			
			<div class="img">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
			</div>
			
			<p>Next, install CPU cooler on CPU.</p>
			<p>Before starting, here's the reason why you need to apply thermal paste on CPU:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>One, at first, the surface between the CPU and the CPU cooler looks smooth that you wouldn't notice uneven surface. However, the imperfection microscopic metal surfaces can lead to air gaps. Thus, result in poor heat transfer. So applying thermal paste to fill in those air gaps will transfer the heat more efficient.</li>
				<li>Two, with the CPU cooler help to reduce performance issue, such as throttling.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For stock CPU cooler, if you're planning to use it, most stock CPU cooler should come with pre-applied thermal paste. Meaning you don't have to use thermal paste. Just simply sat a CPU cooler on CPU and screw in place.</p>
			<p>For third-party CPU cooler, if you're planning to use it, you have to apply thermal paste yourself. Simply by using thermal paste that should came from a CPU cooler box and apply thermal paste on CPU--about the size of uncooked rice. And then place CPU cooler on CPU. Then, screw in place. (NOTE: Most CPU cooler box came with instruction manual, so I advise to read it before installing it.)</p>
			<p>Do not forget to plug the CPU fan shown in the picture.</p>

			</div>
			
			<p>Next, push the memory handle slot each shown in the picture. Insert the memory stick into memory slot as the memory handle slot will automatically secure for you. Also push the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) lane shown in the picture. This will install graphics card later on.</p>

			<!-- Part 3 -->
			<h3>Step 3: Installing Motherboard inside PC Case</h3>
			<p>Before placing motherboard inside a case, one thing we forgot to install is I/O shield that came from motherboard box. Grab the I/O shield, make sure the I/O shield is match to the case on the back panel and push it. It will take a bit of time to fiddle those back plate. So feel free to take off the I/O shield and then push it again until it looks something like shown in the picture.</p>
			
			<div class="img">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
			</div>
			
			<p>Once the I/O shield is in place, grab 6 brass that came from a case and screw it in by using your hands. Take your motherboard and sat on the brass to match holes. Then, grab 6 screws that came from a case and screw on motherboard as shown in the picture.</p>

			<!-- Part 4 -->
			
			<h3>Step 4: Installing Graphics Card/GPU</h3>
			<p>Next is to install a graphics card on a motherboard.</p>
			<p>First, unscrew 3 screws as shown in the left picture and then take out the metal cover.</p>
			<p>Grab a graphics card and insert the PCI slot (x16) and just like the memory handle slot, the PCI handle slot will automatically secure for you.</p>
			<p>Now, grab two screws that came from the case and screw the metal plate as shown in the right picture.</p>
			
			<div class="img">

			</div>

			<!-- Part 5 -->
			<h3>Step 5: Connect Wires</h3>
			<p>After assembling every parts in it, here comes the fun part: wiring. We're going to start connecting wires from the front panel case attached. Here's what we need to connect:</p>
			<div class="img">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
			</div>
			
			<p>First, grab the USB 3.0 wire from the case to connect the motherboard. Next, connect the SATA cord from the motherboard to the SSD/HDD.</p>
			
			<div class="img">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
			</div>
			
			<p>The next part is going to be tricking. If the manual of the motherboard does came from the motherboard box, use it. If not, I'll show you what it looks like shown in the picture. There's the word 'H.D.D LED' and 'RESET SW'--that's going to be plug in in front.</p>
			
			<p>Last two, connect the USB connector and the audio connector shown in the picture.</p>
			<div class="img">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
				<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x330">
			</div>
			<p>Oh, don't forget about connect L-shaped power connector connect to the SSD/HDD.</p>
			
			<p></p>
			
			<!-- Part 6 -->
			<h3>Step 6: Putting Together</h3>
			
			<p>Once everything is done, swing the top panel toward the back panel. Screw two on the side where it belong. Bring the side panels and slide back. Then, screw 6 back by using your hands or screwdriver.</p>
